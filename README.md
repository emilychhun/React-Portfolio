## Description 

  *The what, why, and how:* 
  
  🔍 This is my Portfolio that I used my new React skill.  I want to share my projects not only applying for my jobs or working as a freelance, but also to share my work with fellow developers whose portfolios do not use the lastest technologies. 

 *Check out the [ExampleREADME.md](https://github.com/emilychhun/react-portfolio/blob/main/README.md) as an example.*

  💆🏽💆🏻‍♂️👳🏽👳🏽👳🏻‍♀️👨🏾‍🦽👨🏿‍🤝‍👨🏾As I use this for my own projects, i want to contribute to everybody such as students, my friends, and other users. I know this might not be the perfect README for all projects out there. If your vision of a perfect README.md differs greatly from mine, tell me what you think and we open an issue. If you'd like to contribute,  please do pull requests and make changes as you'd like. In this case, you can create a new file README-yourplatform.md and create the perfect boilerplate for that.
